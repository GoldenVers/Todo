A fullstack MERN project for the daily todo list, the current version allows to add, delete and change the status completion of the tasks, in the future, other functions will be added on top of this

I have made this project to maange my daily tasks, it'd be my pleasure for others to use it as well, this project is the start of series of similar time-management projects

To use this app, all you need is to register in mongodb, make a database and change the url in the index.js file, after making sure that everything is working fine. You are ready to manage your tasks, good luck.
